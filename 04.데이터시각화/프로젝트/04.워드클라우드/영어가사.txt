Yeah, a new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point-blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Ciprianis
Like Beyonc√©, they're getting by, or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce, a whole lot of tears
Rolling down her cheeks, crying 'til she's sound asleep (sleep)
Preach (preach), pray (pray) that today is not a lonely one
You gotta know you're not the only one
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end, I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
Yeah, we all guilty of the same crime if you ask me
I might've had a couple women at the same time
But she can't do the pressure, Jack Daniel's for breakfast
A cap of Valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love
'Til I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices
The Porsche or the fortress? Ignore it or forfeit
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
And I know, and I don't know
I know I'm not the only one
